    <h1>Tor on iOS or iPadOS</h1>
    <p>A frequently asked question is how to access the Tor network from iOS (iPhone) or iPadOS (iPad). The standard answer begins:</p>
    <blockquote>There is no official iOS Tor (Browser) app that is developed by or maintained by the Tor Project.</blockquote>
    <p>The reason for this is that Apple insists that all iOS and iPadOS browsers must use the WebKit rendering engine. The standard Tor Browser on every other platform uses the Gecko rendering engine. Therefore Apple will not allow the standard Tor Browser on its mobile platforms.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately the result is a bewildering number of apps on the App Store that claim to be Tor Browsers. The standard answer continues:</p>
    <blockquote>If you trust the Tor Project, that does not necessarily mean you should trust arbitrary Tor apps you find in the iOS store. Maybe they work. Maybe they are safe. That being said, the Tor Project has endorsed the open source Onion Browser, which is available on the App Store here.</blockquote>
    <p>The recommended app is the one named <strong>Onion Browser</strong> by <strong>Mike Tigas</strong>. Link to App Store page:</p>
    <blockquote><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448</a></blockquote>
    <p>Proof of connection with Tor Project:</p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the Onion Broswer app from the app store, and launch the Onion Browser for the first time.</p>

    <p>You are told you must get Orbot as well, so that the Onion Browser can connect to the Tor network.</p>
    <img src="img/038.png" alt="Onion Browser tells you to install Orbot">
    <p>You are taken to the App Store to install Orbot.</p>
    <img src="img/039.png" alt="App Store prompt to get Orbot">
    <p>Orbot prompts you to install it as a VPN</p>
    <img src="img/040.png" alt="Orbot welcome screen">
    <p>After installation, Orbot prompts you to connect to the Tor network.</p>
    <img src="img/041.png" alt="Orbot ready to connect">
    <p>Orbot connects and displays the progress of the connection.</p>
    <img src="img/042.png" alt="Orbot connecting progress">
    <p>Onion Browser needs permission to access Orbot.</p>
    <img src="img/043.png" alt="Onion Browser requests permission to access Orbot">
    <p>Click Grant in the Access Request box.</p>
    <img src="img/044.png" alt="Access Request Grant button">
    <p>The access request pops up.</p>
    <img src="img/045.png" alt="Onion Browser access request pops up">
    <p>Now that the Onion Browser has access to the Tor network through Orbot, it displays a sceen with some initial links.</p>
    <img src="img/046.png" alt="Onion Browser initial links">
    <p>For example, you could choose the DW onion site.</p>

    <p>And of course you can access any other site you wish.</p>
