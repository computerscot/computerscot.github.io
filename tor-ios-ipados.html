    <h1>Tor on iOS or iPadOS</h1>
    <p>A frequently asked question is how to access the Tor network from iOS (iPhone) or iPadOS (iPad). The standard answer begins:</p>
    <blockquote>There is no official iOS Tor (Browser) app that is developed by or maintained by the Tor Project.</blockquote>
    <p>The reason for this is that Apple insists that all iOS and iPadOS browsers must use the WebKit rendering engine. The standard Tor Browser on every other platform uses the Gecko rendering engine. Therefore Apple will not allow the standard Tor Browser on its mobile platforms.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately the result is a bewildering number of apps on the App Store that claim to be Tor Browsers. The standard answer continues:</p>
    <blockquote>If you trust the Tor Project, that does not necessarily mean you should trust arbitrary Tor apps you find in the iOS store. Maybe they work. Maybe they are safe. That being said, the Tor Project has endorsed the open source Onion Browser, which is available on the App Store here.</blockquote>
    <p>The recommended app is the one named <strong>Onion Browser</strong> by <strong>Mike Tigas</strong>. Link to App Store page:</p>
    <blockquote><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onion-browser/id519296448</a></blockquote>
    <p>Proof of connection with Tor Project:</p>

    <p>Here's how to install the Onion Browser.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the Onion Browser app from the App Store, and launch the Onion Browser for the first time. The initial welcome screen appears.</p>

    <p>The Onion Browser tells you that you must get Orbot as well, so that the Onion Browser can connect to the Tor network.</p>
    <img src="img/038.png" alt="Onion Browser tells you to install Orbot">
    <p>When you press the button to get Orbot, you are taken to the App Store to install Orbot.</p>

    <p>Orbot prompts you to install it as a VPN.</p>

    <p>After installation, Orbot prompts you to start the connection to the Tor network.</p>

    <p>As it makes the connection, Orbot displays its progress in connecting to the Tor network.</p>

    <p>The Onion Browser now requests permission to access Orbot.</p>

    <p>The Access Request box pops up.</p>

    <p>If necessary, scroll down until you see the Grant button.</p>

    <p>Once you have granted the Onion Browser permission to access the Tor network through Orbot, the Onion Browser displays a screen with some initial links.</p>

    <p>For example, you could choose the DW News onion site.</p>

    <p>Here is the DW blog post from June 18, 2021, confirming new V3 onion address:</p>
    <blockquote><a href="https://www.dw.com/de/schutz-vor-hackern-darum-wird-tor-noch-sicherer/a-57953191">https://www.dw.com/de/schutz-vor-hackern-darum-wird-tor-noch-sicherer/a-57953191</a></blockquote>
