    <h1>Country by Country</h1>
    <p><em>July 19, 2023</em></p>

    <h2>China</h2>
    <p>China's GFW is the granddaddy of all firewalls. It is evolving rapidly, so the information you read here may be out of date by the time you read it. The current preferred method is Xray REALITY, especially with gRPC or HTTP/2 transports. Pay particular attention to making sure your domestic traffic does not go out to a foreign server then immediately return to the country, as that marks your server as a sure proxy server. Restrictions are particularly tight during "sensitive" periods. Outside of sensitive periods, the GFW switches from blocking mode to surveillance mode. A summary of counter-censorship methods is <a href="https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/06/01/summary-of-methods">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Egypt</h2>
    <p>Egypt started blocking VPN protocols in 2017. OpenVPN was the last one blocked. A <a href="https://lime-sec.netlify.app/posts/openvpn-dpi-obsfucation">blog post</a> from 2022 says you can be successful in evading DPI if you pass OpenVPN through Shadowsocks. The key step is to include a statement such as <code>socks-proxy 127.0.0.1 1080</code> in the OpenVPN client configuration, where <code>1080</code> is the local port for the Shadowsocks client. This is only possibly on desktop computers, not on mobile. You also need to route your server address directly to prevent a routing loop. I've consolidated notes from various sources into a post <a href="openvpn-over-shadowsocks.html">openvpn-over-shadowsocks.html</a> that outlines the process for Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>

    <h2>Iran</h2>
    <p>The GFW Iran appears to have started with technology similar to the GFW China, but rapidly became even stricter. Some notes on counter-censorship techniques for Iran are <a href="https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/07/03/iran">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Russia</h2>
    <p>Roskomnadzor (Роскомнадзор) has imposed more and more restrictions over the last few years. Blocks are often imposed ISP by ISP by installing a TSPU (ТСПУ, технические средства противодействия угрозам) within the ISP itself. For the latest counter-measures, consult <a href="https://ntc.party/c/internet-censorship-all-around-the-world/russia/12">ntc.party</a>.</p>

    <h2>Turkmenistan</h2>
    <p>Turkmenistan (ISO 3166 code <code>TM</code>) is a landlocked country of 7 million people in Central Asia. It is one of the worst countries in the world for Internet censorship, forcing Muslims to swear on the Quran that they will not use a VPN. A few people have been able to get through the firewall using Tor with bridges. There are occasionally posts about Turmenistan on <a href="https://ntc.party/c/internet-censorship-all-around-the-world/turkmenistan/17">ntc.party</a>.</p>
